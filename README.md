Assignment 8 

A website was created to show different kind of visualizations relating to the world population. The data was taken from (http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&series=SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS&country=#) The World Bank - World Development Indicators.
Using Bootstrap, Angular and D3 layouts with data from previous assignments a website was implemented. A relevant color scheme was also implemented. 
Certain design and implementations considerations are as follows:</p>
Angular cli and node were used to implement the site.</li>
Incremental commits to git with appropriate comments were used.</li>
Consistent color scheme for the legends and the page with Bootstrap components, Angular components were used</li>
The website is currently being hosted at (http://www-scf.usc.edu/~anmolcha/a8/line-chart)
The following charts have been implemented:
Chart 1: Based on the data and design from assignment 2  a bubble chart with D3 using the circle packing layout was created where the mouse hovers on a bubble and shows tooltips with information on the data for that bubble
Chart 2: Using 10 countries and the data from assignment 1, a responsive line chart similar to what Google charts was generated, complete with a legend. Line selection with pop-out effect (one line can be selected at a time) with a mechanism to show/hide data points on the chartwas implemented
Chart 3: Using 5 countries and percentage rural population, a pie chart using Bootstrap was implemented to create a card to show generic data information and information on how to interact with the chart when the mouse is not hovering on the pie chart and when the mouse is hovering,over a sector of the pie chart, information that corresponds to the data for that sector is shown with a visual feedback on mouse hover was shown.
